libkindrv
====================

Open source library with libusb-based drivers to control robotic arms by Kinova.


Installing:
====================

The installation procedure is based on cmake and contains nothing
more than the usual procedure:

  # 1. Make a "build" directory inside libkindrv directory

    mkdir build

  # 2. Run cmake from inside the "build" directory

    cd build
    cmake ..

  # 3. Build the kindrv library

    make

  # 4. Install the kindrv library (may need root privileges)

    make install

  # 5. Copy 10-libkindr.rules into your udev-rules directory (e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/)

    sudo cp ../10-libkindrv.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

  # 6. [Optional] Remove "build" directory. Skip this step if you want to allow fast uninstalling.

    cd ..
    rm -rf build

  # 7. [Optional] Build documentation (will build into doc/html directory inside libkindrv directory)

    doxygen Doxyfile.in


Uninstalling:
====================
In case you removed the "build" directory, repeat installation steps #1 and #2.
Simply execute the following from inside the "build" directory (may need root privileges) :

    make uninstall



Other notes:
====================
Of course the default cmake options are availabe, as well as
using the GUI version of cmake in installation step #2 with

    cd build
    ccmake ..
