libkindrv
=========

Open source library with libusb-based drivers to control robotic arms by Kinova.


Installation:
=============

The installation procedure is based on cmake and contains nothing
more than the usual procedure:

  # 1. Make a build directory inside libkindrv directory

    mkdir build

  # 2. Run cmake from inside the build directory

    cd build
    cmake ..

  # 3. Build the kindrv library

    make

  # 4. Install the kindrv library (may need root privileges)

    make install

  # 5. [Optional] Remove build directory

    cd ..
    rm -rf build

  # 6. [Optional] Build documentation (will build into doc/html directory inside libkindrv directory)

    doxygen Doxyfile.in


Of course the default cmake options are availabe, as well as
using the GUI version of cmake in step 2 with

    cd build
    ccmake ..
